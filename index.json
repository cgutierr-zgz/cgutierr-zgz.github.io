This allows you to persist user settings, such as theme, language, and other preferences.\nhydrated_bloc uses hive as the underlying storage mechanism, which is a fast, NoSQL database that runs on mobile, desktop, and the web.\nHow to use hydrated_bloc 🤔 # To use hydrated_bloc, you need to add it to your pubspec.yaml file:\ndependencies: hydrated_bloc: Then, you need to initialize the storage. You can use the HydratedStorage.build() method to create a storage instance. You can then pass this instance to the HydratedBloc.storage property.\nIn this example, we will make use of the package path_provider to get the path to the app\u0026rsquo;s document directory and the HydratedStorage.webStorageDirectory for web. We will then use this paths to initialize the storage:\nWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); HydratedBloc.storage = await HydratedStorage.build( storageDirectory: kIsWeb ? HydratedStorage.webStorageDirectory // for web : await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory(), // everything else ); Now that we have our storage initialized, we can start using hydrated_bloc. We will start by creating a Settings class, that will be used to store the user settings:\n@immutable class Settings extends Equatable { const Settings({ required this.themeMode, }); final ThemeMode themeMode; // ... place other settings here Settings copyWith({ThemeMode? themeMode}) =\u0026gt; Settings(themeMode: themeMode ?? this.themeMode); Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; toJson() =\u0026gt; {\u0026#39;themeMode\u0026#39;: themeMode.index}; factory Settings.fromJson(Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; map) =\u0026gt; Settings(themeMode: ThemeMode.values[map[\u0026#39;themeMode\u0026#39;] as int]); @override bool get stringify =\u0026gt; true; @override List\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; get props =\u0026gt; [themeMode]; } Now that our user settings are defined, we can create a SettingsCubit that extends HydratedCubit, this cubit will be responsible for updating and persisting the user settings.\nWe will add a toggleThemeMode method to the cubit, that will be used to update the theme:\nclass SettingsCubit extends HydratedCubit\u0026lt;Settings\u0026gt; { SettingsCubit() : super(const Settings(themeMode: ThemeMode.system)); void toggleThemeMode(ThemeMode themeMode) =\u0026gt; emit(state.copyWith(themeMode: themeMode)); @override Settings fromJson(Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; json) =\u0026gt; Settings.fromJson(json); @override Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; toJson(Settings state) =\u0026gt; state.toJson(); } Since the data we want to persist is the user settings is safe to say that providing this at root level is a good idea.\nWe can do so by using a BlocProvider, thanks to the flutter_bloc package (dont forget to add it to your pubspec.yaml):\nrunApp( // Provides the settings cubit to the root BlocProvider( create: (context) =\u0026gt; SettingsCubit(), child: const MyApp(), ), ); Having the SettingsCubit available at root level, we can now use context.select to get the current theme mode and use it to set the theme mode of our app:\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget { const MyApp({super.key}); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( title: \u0026#39;Hydated Storage Demo\u0026#39;, theme: ThemeData.light(), darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // It only listen to the themeMode of the cubit themeMode: context.select((SettingsCubit c) =\u0026gt; c.state.themeMode), home: const SettingsPage(), ); } } Finally, let\u0026rsquo;s create a SettingsPage that will allow the user to change the theme mode:\nclass SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget { const SettingsPage({super.key}); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { final themeMode = context.select( (SettingsCubit c) =\u0026gt; c.state.themeMode, ); return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: const Text(\u0026#39;Settings Page\u0026#39;), ), body: Center( child: Column( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, children: [ Text(\u0026#39;Current theme mode: $themeMode\u0026#39;), ...List.generate( ThemeMode.values.length, (index) { final themeMode = ThemeMode.values[index]; return ElevatedButton( onPressed: () =\u0026gt; context.read\u0026lt;SettingsCubit\u0026gt;().toggleThemeMode( themeMode, ), child: Text(themeMode.name), ); }, ), ], ), ), ); } } And... that's it! 🎉 🎉 🎉\nOur user settings are now persisted to disk and we could use them to update the app's theme, language, etc. Conclusion 📝 # In this post, I showed you how to use hydrated_bloc to persist user settings in a Flutter app. I hope you found this post useful.
