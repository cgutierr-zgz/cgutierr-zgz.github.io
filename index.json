This post was made using go_router version 5.1.5\nWhat are enhanced enums? 🤔 # Enhanced enums are a great way to define a set of values that are known at compile time. They are similar to the enum type, but they can also have methods and properties.\nThe new enhanced enums are available since Dart 2.17\nHow to use enhanced enums 🎯 # First, ensure your dart/flutter project is using at least Dart 2.17.0 in your pubspec.yaml:\nenvironment: sdk: \u0026#34;\u0026gt;=2.17.0 \u0026lt;3.0.0\u0026#34; Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a simple example. We want to define a set of routes for our app. We can do this by creating an enum:\nenum AppRoutes { login, home, settings, } Now that we have our enum, we can enhance it to define our routes, views, etc\u0026hellip;\nenum AppRoutes { login(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;, LoginPage()), home(\u0026#39;/home\u0026#39;, HomePage()), settings(\u0026#39;/settings\u0026#39;, SettingsPage()); // Don\u0026#39;t forget to add the semicolon here :) const AppRoutes( this.path, this.view, ); final String path; final Widget view; } That\u0026rsquo;s it! Now our enum has a path and a view.\nCombining enhanced enums with go_router 🚀 # Now that we have our enhanced enum, we can use it with go_router to define our routes.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first add the go_router dependency to our pubspec.yaml:\ndependencies: go_router: ^5.1.5 And now let\u0026rsquo;s create our router:\nfinal router = GoRouter( initialLocation: AppRoutes.login.path, routes: [ GoRoute( path: AppRoutes.login.path, pageBuilder: (context, state) =\u0026gt; MaterialPage\u0026lt;void\u0026gt;( key: state.pageKey, child: AppRoutes.login.view, ), ), // ... same for home/settings using AppRoutes.x.path and x.home.view ], ); This already looks much better than the previous version, where we had to define the routes and views manually:\nfinal router = GoRouter( initialLocation: \u0026#39;/login\u0026#39;, routes: [ GoRoute( path: \u0026#39;/login\u0026#39;, pageBuilder: (context, state) =\u0026gt; MaterialPage\u0026lt;void\u0026gt;( key: state.pageKey, child: LoginPage(), ), ), // ... ); Anyway, we can make this even better by adding a method to our enum so that we can get the route directly from the enum just by calling AppRoutes.routeX.route:\nenum AppRoutes { // ... GoRoute get route =\u0026gt; GoRoute( path: path, pageBuilder: (context, state) =\u0026gt; MaterialPage\u0026lt;void\u0026gt;( key: state.pageKey, child: view, ), ); } This will allow us to simplify our router:\nfinal router = GoRouter( initialLocation: AppRoutes.login.path, routes: [ AppRoutes.login.route, AppRoutes.home.route, AppRoutes.settings.route, ], ); I like it picasso! 🎨\nAdding our router 🚧 # Now that we have our router, we can add it to our app by updating our MaterialApp widget with a .router() constructor and adding a routerConfig parameter:\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget { const MyApp({super.key}); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp.router( title: \u0026#39;Enums and Router demo\u0026#39;, routerConfig: router, ); } } Now that we have our router, we can easily navigate to those known routes, let\u0026rsquo;s test it by adding a text button to the login page:\n//... TextButton( onPressed: () =\u0026gt; context.go(AppRoutes.home.path), child: Text(\u0026#39;Home\u0026#39;), ), //... We can even simplify this by adding another method to our enum:\nenum AppRoutes { // ... void go(BuildContext context) =\u0026gt; context.go(path); // Additionall, we can add push and replace methods :) void push(BuildContext context) =\u0026gt; context.push(path); void replace(BuildContext context) =\u0026gt; context.replace(path); } And now we can use it like this:\n//... TextButton( onPressed: () =\u0026gt; AppRoutes.home.go(context), child: Text(\u0026#39;Home\u0026#39;), ), //... Now navigating seems much easier and less error-prone 😄\nConclusion 📝 # In this post, I showed you how I like to use enhanced enums with go_router in order navigate in a more type-safe, less error-prone and in my opinion more readable way.\nFor sure there are some use cases where this approach might not be the best, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth trying it out and see if it fits your needs 😉\nI hope you enjoyed it and that you found it useful.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment below. 😄\nThanks for reading! 🤓\nExtra 🎁 # The full source code for this post is available here 🔍\nThe pubspec.yaml file for this project uses the following dependencies 📦\ndependencies: flutter: sdk: flutter go_router: ^5.1.5 # Used to define our router dev_dependencies: flutter_test: sdk: flutter very_good_analysis: ^3.1.0 # Used to enforce very good practices 🦄 References 📚 # go_router Dart enums Dart 2.17.0 ","date":"9 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/go_router_enums/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to use enhanced enums with go_router to create a more type-safe navigation system.","title":"Using enhanced enums with go_router"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2022","permalink":"/tags/bloc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"bloc"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2022","permalink":"/tags/hydrated_bloc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"hydrated_bloc"},{"content":" hydrated_bloc by Felix Angelov In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to use hydrated_bloc to update and persist user settings like theme, language, etc. in a Flutter app.\nThis post was made using hydrated_bloc version 9.0.0\nWhat is hydrated_bloc? 🧐 # hydrated_bloc is a package that extends the bloc package to persist state changes to disk. This allows you to persist user settings, such as theme, language, and other preferences.\nhydrated_bloc uses hive as the underlying storage mechanism, which is a fast, NoSQL database that runs on mobile, desktop, and the web.\nSetup hydrated_bloc 🛠️ # To use hydrated_bloc, you need to add it to your pubspec.yaml file:\ndependencies: hydrated_bloc: ^9.0.0 Then, you need to initialize the storage. You can use the HydratedStorage.build() method to create a storage instance. You can then pass this instance to the HydratedBloc.storage property.\nIn this example, we will make use of the package path_provider to get the path to the app\u0026rsquo;s document directory and the HydratedStorage.webStorageDirectory for web. We will then use this paths to initialize the storage:\nvoid main() { WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); HydratedBloc.storage = await HydratedStorage.build( storageDirectory: kIsWeb ? HydratedStorage.webStorageDirectory // for web : await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory(), // everything else ); // ... runApp } Using hydrated_bloc 🎯 # Now that we have our storage initialized, we can start using hydrated_bloc. We will start by creating a Settings class, that will be used to store the user settings:\n@immutable class Settings extends Equatable { const Settings({ required this.themeMode, }); final ThemeMode themeMode; // ... place other settings here Settings copyWith({ThemeMode? themeMode}) =\u0026gt; Settings(themeMode: themeMode ?? this.themeMode); Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; toJson() =\u0026gt; {\u0026#39;themeMode\u0026#39;: themeMode.index}; factory Settings.fromJson(Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; map) =\u0026gt; Settings(themeMode: ThemeMode.values[map[\u0026#39;themeMode\u0026#39;] as int]); @override bool get stringify =\u0026gt; true; @override List\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; get props =\u0026gt; [themeMode]; } Now that our user settings are defined, we can create a SettingsCubit that extends HydratedCubit, this cubit will be responsible for updating and persisting the user settings.\nWe will add a toggleThemeMode method to the cubit, that will be used to update the theme:\nclass SettingsCubit extends HydratedCubit\u0026lt;Settings\u0026gt; { SettingsCubit() : super(const Settings(themeMode: ThemeMode.system)); void toggleThemeMode(ThemeMode themeMode) =\u0026gt; emit(state.copyWith(themeMode: themeMode)); @override Settings fromJson(Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; json) =\u0026gt; Settings.fromJson(json); @override Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; toJson(Settings state) =\u0026gt; state.toJson(); } Important: Persisting multiple instances of the same cubit hydrated_bloc has a really cool feature which allows us to override a given id, this is useful when we want to have multiple instances of the same cubit. For example, if we want to have a SettingsCubit for each user, we can override the id property to use the user\u0026rsquo;s id:\n// ... final carlosCubit = SettingsCubit(\u0026#39;carlos\u0026#39;); final dimaCubit = SettingsCubit(\u0026#39;dima\u0026#39;); // ... class SettingsCubit extends HydratedCubit\u0026lt;Settings\u0026gt; { SettingsCubit(this._id) : super(const Settings(themeMode: ThemeMode.system)); final String _id; @override String get id =\u0026gt; _id; //... other methods } Since the data we want to persist is the user settings is safe to say that providing this at root level is a good idea.\nWe can do so by using a BlocProvider, thanks to the flutter_bloc package (dont forget to add it to your pubspec.yaml):\nvoid main() { // ... Setup storage runApp( // Provides the settings cubit to the root BlocProvider( create: (_) =\u0026gt; SettingsCubit(), child: const MyApp(), ), ); } Having the SettingsCubit available at root level, we can now use context.select to get the current theme mode and use it to set the theme mode of our app:\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget { const MyApp({super.key}); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( title: \u0026#39;Hydated Storage Demo\u0026#39;, theme: ThemeData.light(), darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // It only listen to the themeMode of the cubit themeMode: context.select((SettingsCubit c) =\u0026gt; c.state.themeMode), home: const SettingsPage(), ); } } Finally, let\u0026rsquo;s create a SettingsPage that will allow the user to change the theme mode:\nclass SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget { const SettingsPage({super.key}); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { final themeMode = context.select( (SettingsCubit c) =\u0026gt; c.state.themeMode, ); return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: const Text(\u0026#39;Settings Page\u0026#39;), ), body: Center( child: Column( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, children: [ Text(\u0026#39;Current theme mode: $themeMode\u0026#39;), // Using the ThemeMode enum to get the available options ...List.generate( ThemeMode.values.length, (index) { final themeMode = ThemeMode.values[index]; return ElevatedButton( onPressed: () =\u0026gt; context.read\u0026lt;SettingsCubit\u0026gt;() .toggleThemeMode(themeMode), child: Text(themeMode.name), ); }, ), ], ), ), ); } } And... that's it! 🎉\nOur user settings are now persisted to disk and we could use them to update the app's theme, language, etc.\nEasy, right? 😄 Conclusion 📝 # In this post, I showed you how to use hydrated_bloc to update and persist user settings in a Flutter app. I hope you found this post useful.\nI hope you enjoyed it and that you found it useful.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment below. 😄\nThanks for reading! 🤓\nExtra 🎁 # The full source code with 100% test coverage 🧪 for this post is available here 🔍\nThe pubspec.yaml file for this project uses the following dependencies 📦\ndependencies: bloc: ^8.1.0 equatable: ^2.0.5 # Used to compare objects flutter: sdk: flutter flutter_bloc: ^8.1.1 # Used to provide the cubit to the root hydrated_bloc: ^9.0.0 # Used to persist the cubit state path_provider: ^2.0.11 # Used to get the storage directory path dev_dependencies: bloc_test: ^9.1.0 # Used to test the cubit flutter_test: sdk: flutter mocktail: ^0.3.0 # Used to mock the storage path: ^1.8.2 # Used to create a mock storage very_good_analysis: ^3.1.0 # Used to enforce very good practices 🦄 References 📚 # bloc equatable flutter_bloc hydrated_bloc hive path_provider bloc_test mocktail path very_good_analysis ","date":"8 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/storing-settings-with-hydrated-bloc/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to use hydrated_bloc to update and persist user settings in a Flutter app.","title":"Update and persist user settings with hydrated_bloc"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2022","permalink":"/data-privacy/","section":"Data-privacies","summary":"","title":"Data-privacies"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2022","permalink":"/tags/data-privacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"data-privacy"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2022","permalink":"/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"hugo"},{"content":"","date":"3 November 2022","permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"web"},{"content":"PRIVACY POLICY # This Privacy Policy sets forth the terms under which cgutierr-zgz.github.io uses and protects the information provided by its users when using its website. provided by its users at the time of using its website.
