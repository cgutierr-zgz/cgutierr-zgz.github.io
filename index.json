This allows you to persist user settings, such as theme, language, and other preferences.\nhydrated_bloc uses hive as the underlying storage mechanism, which is a fast, NoSQL database that runs on mobile, desktop, and the web.\nHow to use hydrated_bloc # To use hydrated_bloc, you need to add it to your pubspec.yaml file:\ndependencies: hydrated_bloc: Then, you need to initialize the storage. You can use the HydratedStorage.build() method to create a storage instance. You can then pass this instance to the HydratedBloc.storage property:\nvoid main() async { WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); HydratedBloc.storage = await HydratedStorage.build(); runApp(MyApp()); } You can then use the HydratedBloc class to create your blocs. This class extends the Bloc class, so you can use it in the same way as the Bloc class.\nclass ThemeBloc extends HydratedBloc\u0026lt;ThemeEvent, ThemeState\u0026gt; { ThemeBloc() : super(ThemeState.light()); @override Stream\u0026lt;ThemeState\u0026gt; mapEventToState(ThemeEvent event) async* { if (event is ThemeChanged) { yield event.theme; } } @override ThemeState fromJson(Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; json) { try { return ThemeState.values[json[\u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;] as int]; } catch (_) { return null; } } @override Map\u0026lt;String, int\u0026gt; toJson(ThemeState state) { return {\u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: state.index}; } } Conclusion # In this post, I showed you how to use hydrated_bloc to persist user settings in a Flutter app. I hope you found this post useful.
